# Expense Tracker  

## üìå Project Overview  
Expense Tracker is a web application designed to help users manage their daily expenses effectively. The app allows users to add expenses with details such as name, amount, and category. It also provides an overview of total expenses and allows users to filter expenses by category or delete entries when necessary. The application is mobile-friendly and built with modern web technologies.  

Unlike traditional implementations that use **LocalStorage**, this app leverages **IndexedDB (IDB)** for persistent data storage, ensuring better performance and scalability.

### ‚û§ Mobile-Friendly Design
The app is fully responsive and can be accessed on mobile devices.

### üìÑ Documentation
